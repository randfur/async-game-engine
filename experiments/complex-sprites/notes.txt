Sprite sub sprites:
- Data format:
  - Sprite:
    - Sub sprite list.
    - Keyframe list.
  - Sub sprite:
    - Name.
    - Sprite name.
    - Time skip.
  - Keyframe:
    - Optional image src.
    - Sub sprite placement list.
  - Sub sprite placement:
    - Sub sprite name.
    - Transform.
    - Maybe reset to time.
- Should allow for things like dripping animations on characters and reusing animation parts.
- Basically like a 2D sprite rig.
- All sub sprites manually placed, no motion tweening.
- Makes sprite packs make more sense now that they can reference each other.
- Disallow recursion, sub sprite instantiation checks for cycles.
- Maybe also expose attachment points e.g. where bullets should come out of.
  - Can they live in sub sprites?
    - What if there are collisions?
    - Which one wins?
    - How bad is the look up complexity?
Maybe ditch the JSON and definition parsers for now.
- Go with raw data model behaviour implementation and stabilise on that first.
Maybe focus more on editor.
- Stick to 32x32 for simplicity for now.

Keyframes:
- Allow frame count randomisation.
  - Should allow for more complex looking scenery without any code.
  - Add framesDeviate number field.
    - Adds +/- the value to frames each time that keyframe is activated.
