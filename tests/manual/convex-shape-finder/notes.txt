For each side:
- Find peak points
- For left and right directions (e.g. right):
  - Find rightmost peak.
  - For each height from right most edge inwards:
    - Create line from peak corner to height corner and save as "best" with endpoint.
    - If line contains more than previous best:
      - Save new line as best.
      - Create new segment from height to last best line endpoint.

What does "contains more" mean?
- Has less steep rise over run.
